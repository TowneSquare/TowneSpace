### Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in TowneSquare Marketplace, we encourage you to let us know right away. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.

To report a problem shoot me an email at j.hughes@townesquare.xyz directly.

### Responsible Research and Disclosure Policy

When participating in vulnerability testing, we require that:

1. You make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and disruptions to others, including (but not limited to) unauthorised access to or destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our services. You must not intentionally violate any applicable laws or regulations, including (but not limited to) laws and regulations prohibiting the unauthorised access to data.
2. If you inadvertently access another person's data or TowneSquare company data without authorisation while investigating an issue, you must promptly cease any activity that might result in further access of user or TowneSquare company data and notify TowneSquare what information was accessed (including a full description of the contents of the information) and then immediately delete the information from your system. Continuing to access another person's data or company data may demonstrate a lack of good faith and disqualify you from any benefit of the Safe Harbour Provisions described below. You may not share the inadvertently accessed information with anyone else.
3. You do not exploit a security issue that you discover for any reason other than for testing purposes. (This includes demonstrating additional risk, such as the risk that the security issue could be used to compromise sensitive company data)
4. You give us reasonable time to investigate and mitigate an issue that you report before publicly disclosing any information about the report or sharing such information with others.

### Safe Harbour Provisions

1. We consider these terms to provide you with authorisation, including under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), to test the security of the products and systems identified as in-scope below. These terms do not provide you with authorisation to intentionally access company data or data from another person's account without their express consent, including (but not limited to) personally identifiable information or data relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.
2. If TowneSquare determines in its sole discretion that you have complied in all respects in reporting a security issue to TowneSquare, we will not initiate a complaint to law enforcement or pursue a civil action against you, to include civil actions under the CFAA in connection with the research underlying your report and DMCA claims against you for circumventing the technological measures that we have used to protect the applications in scope. TowneSquare will also not pursue legal action against you for clear accidental or good faith violations of its policy or these terms.
3. Your use of TowneSquare technologies and programmes, including for purposes of this programme, remains subject to TowneSquare's Terms and Policies.
4. If legal action is initiated by a third party against you for conduct that TowneSquare determines to have complied with these terms, TowneSquare will take steps to make it known, either to the public or the court, that your actions were authorised under this programme.
