Today marks my first day at TowneSquare as a blockchain engineer. I'm so excited for the journey and for what lies ahead. For those who may not be familiar, TowneSquare is a web3 social network that is built on top of Aptos. TowneSquare will soon be launching on the mainnet, so be sure to stay tuned for updates and developments.
